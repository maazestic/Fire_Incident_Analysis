## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maazestic/Fire_Incident_Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Fire_Incident_Analysis
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Analysis

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is crucial for any analysis. In this project, we handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types as needed. This step ensures that our models work with high-quality data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps us understand the dataset better. We visualize distributions, correlations, and trends in the data. Key visualizations include:

- Histograms for feature distributions
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis
- Time series plots for fire incidents over time

### Modeling

We employ various machine learning models to analyze the data.

#### Classification

For classification tasks, we use algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. These models help us predict whether a fire incident will occur based on historical data.

#### Regression

Regression models, including Gradient Boosting, allow us to predict the intensity of fire incidents. We evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

#### Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection techniques identify unusual fire incidents. This step is crucial for early warning systems.

## Visualizations

Visualizations play a key role in understanding the data. We create various plots to represent our findings:

- **Fire Incident Heatmap**: Shows the density of fire incidents across regions.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Displays trends over time.
- **Feature Importance Plot**: Highlights which features contribute most to our predictions.

---

## Insights

Our analysis reveals several key insights:

- Certain regions experience more fire incidents than others.
- Specific features, such as temperature and humidity, significantly impact fire intensity.
- Anomalies in fire incidents can indicate underlying issues that require further investigation.
